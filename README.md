# FibonacciSeries

This File computes the nth term of the famous *Fibonacci* Series.

Fibonacci Series is :-

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 . . .

Here are two programs on this.

One program contains the *recursive* method and another contains the *iterative* method.

The *iterative* method is preferable over *recursive* method for this problem, because here *recursion* may lead to crashing the program in case of larger position numbers..

Yet the *recursion* may still be used for smaller position numbers.
